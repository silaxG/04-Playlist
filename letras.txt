1-Decadence-Disturbed-Ten thousand fists-3:25
Letra
Say, yes they know that you hurt yourself another time
Don't they know that you're full of pain already?
Yes they know that you hurt yourself another time
Decadence isn't easy, is it?
Yes they know that you hurt yourself another time
Don't they know that you're full of pain already?
Yes they know that you hurt yourself another time
Decadence isn't easy

Then you slowly recall all your mind
Why, your soul's gone cold, and all hope has run dry
Dead inside
Never enough to forget that you're one of the lonely
Slowly recall all your mind

Say, yes they know that you hurt yourself another time
Don't they know that you're full of pain already?
Yes they know that you hurt yourself another time
Decadence isn't easy, is it?
Yes they know that you hurt yourself another time
Don't they know that you're full of pain already?
Yes they know that you hurt yourself another time
Decadence isn't easy

Slowly recall all your mind
Why, your soul's gone cold, and all hope has run dry
Dead inside
Never enough to forget that you're one of the lonely
Slowly recall all your mind

If I scare you now
Don't run from me
I've been hiding my pain, you see
Said if I scare you now
Don't run from me
I've been hiding my pain, you see

Slowly recall all your mind
Why, your soul's gone cold, and all hope has run dry
Dead inside
Never enough to forget that you're one of the lonely
Slowly recall all your mind
Slowly recall all your mind

Say, yes they know that you hurt yourself another time
Don't they know that you're full of pain already?
Yes they know that you hurt yourself another time
Decadence isn't easy is it

2- The diary of jane-Breaking Benjamin-Phobia-3:20
Letra
If I had to
I would put myself right beside you
So let me ask, would you like that?
Would you like that?
And I don't mind
If you say this love is the last time
So now I'll ask, do you like that?
Do you like that?
No!

Something's getting in the way
Something's just about to break
I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane
So tell me how it should be

Try to find out what makes you tick
As I lie down
Sore and sick, do you like that?
Do you like that?
There's a fine line between love and hate
And I don't mind
Just let me say that I like that
I like that

Something's getting in the way
Something's just about to break
I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane
As I burn another page
As I look the other way
I still try to find my place in the diary of Jane
So tell me how it should be

Desperate, I will crawl
Waiting for so long
No love, there is no love
Die for anyone
What have I become?!

Something's getting in the way
Something's just about to break
I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane
As I burn another page
As I look the other way
I still try to find my place in the diary of Jane

Letra
Hey-oh, here comes the danger up in this club
When we get started and we ain't gon' stop
We gon' turn it out 'til it gets too hot
Everybody sing, hey-oh
Tell 'em turn it up 'til they can't no more
Let's get this thing shakin' like a disco ball
This is your last warning, a courtesy call

Hey-oh, here comes the danger up in this club

This is your last warning, a courtesy call

I am not afraid of the storm that comes my way
When it hits, it shakes me to the core
And makes me stronger than before
It's not a question about trust
But will you stand with us?
Can you feel it, make it real

I think it might wash away tonight
Awaken from this never-ending fight
It takes more than meets the eye
This war we're fighting is not just rotting

Let's get this thing shakin' like a disco ball
This is your last warning, a courtesy call

There's a rumble in the floor
So get prepared for war
When it hits, it'll knock you to the ground
When it shakes up everything around
But survival is a must
So will you stand with us
Can you feel it, make it real
Make me feel it

I think it might wash away tonight
Awaken from this never-ending fight
It takes more than meets the eye
This war we're fighting is not just rotting

Hey-oh, here comes the danger up in this club
When we get started and we ain't gon' stop
We gon' turn it out 'til it gets too hot
Everybody sing, hey-oh
Tell 'em turn it up 'til they can't no more

Let's get this thing shakin' like a disco ball
This is your last warning, a courtesy call

Letra 
First things first, I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up, and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh
Second thing second, don't you tell me what you think that I can be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feelin' me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Pain!
You break me down, and build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive it came from
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Third things third, send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

I was choking in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited, 'til it broke open, and it rained down
It rained down like

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, and build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive it came from
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Last things last, by the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh

But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited, 'til it broke open, and it rained down
It rained down like

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Pain!
You break me down, and build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive it came from

Letra
When you scream aloud
Heads down, heads down
That's when I plan to
Rise up, rise up
When you scream aloud
We're doomed, we're doomed
That's when I plan to prove myself to you

I've never gotten the simple thrill of solo day
I've never seen the point in you, killing you
I've always backed my words with what I do
I'll always bite my tongue to comfort you

I'll be my superhero #1
I'll save me from myself

I... I rise
Above the sun in the sky
Above that look in your eyes
My pride

Sister you know me
Si-sister you know me
Mother you made me
Lover what do you offer me?
Father teach me
Brother protect
Lover what do you have for me?

I'll be your superhero #1
I'll save you... I save

I... I rise
Above the sun in the sky

Your eyes deny, a life that dulls your pride
Your eyes they hide, through me you'll heal with time, Yeah

Letra
Get ready
Get ready, get set
Get ready, get set, let's roll

Ha, get ready, get set, let's roll
Roll rubber in a bit of petrol
Red, yellow, hit green, then go
Breathe in slow

S.O.B.
You ain't never seen nothing so rugged at 90
Huh uh
Goosebumps when the cops behind me yo!
The boiler's grinding, keep the cuffs
Enjoy your doughnuts, Sir, you ain't gonna find me

It's not likely their brains is blown out
You're chasing a ghost with no brakes, slow down
Hundred proof octane, ready to drink bitch
Stop playing, I'm hot man, gimme that pink slip

Time's up, the animals crept through
Leave them in the dust with a packet of jet fuel
Too quick, eat 'em up, better for pet food
No brain, slow lane, missing your head screws

Ha, skin and bones let, mess with your chrome set
Tricked out, hopping like your cruse in a cold chest
Parked in eagle with a safety pin
Take the backseat
Now let the games begin, yeah

Ha, get ready, get set, let's roll
Roll rubber in a bit of petrol
Red, yellow, hit green, then go
Breathe in slow

Shapeshifter!
Come on man, you can't be real
I'mma show you what it is, let the anthem build
Shapeshifter!
Put the pedal to the metal and go (Go!)

Tough match, you lost by a hubcap
The big boss spray painted on my mud flap
Get a rush, yeah we're calling your cold bluff
We never get enough

Step in, hold your breath and hang tight
Known for the big dollar bet in the cage fight
You're playing with the sharks, step inside
Everybody on your mark, get set, now let's ride

That's right
Put the pedal to the metal and go
The yellow madellow with slicks on sending 'em home
Stick cars in the concrete, gripping the road
So quick, even the palm trees, look out whoa

We got car keys hooked to remote controls
Hit a button that'll smoke any whip you own
I told you, I don't want to close your casket
Quit now before you go blowing a gasket

Ha, get ready, get set, let's roll
Roll rubber in a bit of petrol
Red, yellow, hit green, then go
Breathe in slow

Shapeshifter!
Come on man, you can't be real
I'mma show you what it is, let the anthem build
Shapeshifter!
Put the pedal to the metal and go (Go!)

(Go, go, go!)
Melting!
Meltdown!
(While time is shifting)
Transist!
Transform!
(Out purposely)

Yielding!
Bending!
(While time is shifting)
Two shapes they can't constrain!
Get ready, get set, let's roll

Shapeshifter!
Come on man, you can't be real
I'mma show you what it is, let the anthem build
Shapeshifter!
If you want it, come and let me know
I'm right here, put the pedal to the metal and go (Go!)

Shapeshifter!
Come on man, you can't be real
I'll show you what it is, let the anthem build
Shapeshifter!
Put the pedal to the metal and go (Go!)

Letra
Hu
I'm like hu-hu
Hu
I'm like hu-hu

Hey yo, first things first
Box battle and break down
For the beak in the rhyme tone
Jump in the cyclone
S-T-Y-L-E-S, yes I know
Give the rap phene vaccine

Packed red beam
Put 'em up, what the fuck
You plucked a bad seed
Off the wall, spittin' the guerilla tag team
What's up now, duck down stuff that can't breathe

Yo- you know the routine, the demon effect
Please, don't step, you wanna be one of my pet peeves
The more beef the better; sound gay
But you all wanna sleep together, okay
In the club we gon' sneak Berettas
Why not? We got so much street credit, the fuckin' police let us
Now that's bullshit, 'cause we don't pack heat
So come and get your head crackin' up at me

Kick it- movin' it's on now
Making it punk loud
Shaking the buck wild
Rapin' the punk style
Fakin' the funk pal
Dunk watch the punk

What now? Watch your battleship get sunk down
Click (click) pow (pow) knocked (knocked) out (out)
What? Just what I thought, what's up now?
Click (click) pow (pow) knocked (knocked) out (out)
What? Just what I thought, what's up now?

Hu
I'm like hu-hu

Hold it down, never give in
Styles ever get limbs
Or whether you want it to end
Dirty syringe, I murder 'em again
'97 serving them sins
Uh 30 your friends get knocked out, turbulent wind
Hopped out, what you want, big verb in the gin
I'm a fish, you can tell by the flippers or fins (c'mon)

Yo- I got a rock style
Pivot the offspring and joke with 'em
With a distorted gist off string
Who am i? Rushin' what leg? Who and Tak?
Pushin' your bed hotter than Quebec in July
Area 51, stereo, rive gun live

Here we go, S-O-B drop some
For the kids in the hall with the new block tape
Blast from both angles like boom dock saint
So, get up, get up and let the sound hit ya
Snap it's already ya style picture, hu

Kick it- movin' it's on now
Making it punk loud
Shaking the buck wild
Rapin' the punk style
Fakin' the funk pal
Dunk watch the punk

What now? Watch your battleship get sunk down
Click (click) pow (pow) knocked (knocked) out (out)
What? Just what I thought, what's up now?
Click (click) pow (pow) knocked (knocked) out (out)
What? Just what I thought, what's up now?

Hu
I'm like hu-hu

Huh, who the hell wear splittin' the belly up on a selfish
Shinnin' in your style playin' the fell blitz
Drillin' your brain, like rap and video games
Feel the seringe for the styles that stickin' in your brain

Yo- what kind of shit is he on
Really is styles, really be on
C'mon punk fuck off, you really gotta be gone
Ripped out of your brain
Pissed covered in shit to diss this S-O-B game

Son of a bitch
I'ma start killin' for kicks
There ain't an Air Force 1 in the globe I can't fig, get it?
I'm sick with it, when I spit the venom
And it drips up in 'em, and it gets the women in a
Quick dilemma, we can settle it now
And I don't know who did it but they said it was styles

(Click, pow, knocked out)
(What? Just what I thought, what's up now?)

Hu
I'm like hu-hu
Hu
I'm like hu-hu
Hu

(Click, pow, knocked out)
(What? Just what I thought, what's up now?)
I'm like hu-hu
(Click, pow, knocked out)

8-Blow me away- Breaking benjamin- Halo 2, Vol. 1 (Original Soundtrack)-3:25
They fall in line
One at a time
Ready to play
(I can't see them anyway)

No time to lose
We've got to move
Steady your helm
(I am losing sight again)

Fire your guns
It's time to run
Blow me away
(I will stay in the mess I made)
After the fall
We'll shake it off
Show me the way

Only the strongest will survive
Lead me to Heaven when we die
I am the shadow on the wall
I'll be the one to save us all

There's nothing left
So save your breath
Lying in wait
(Caught inside this tidal wave)

Your cover's blown
Nowhere to go
Holding your fate
(Loaded I will walk alone)

Fire your guns
It's time to run
Blow me away
(I will stay in the mess I made)
After the fall
We'll shake it off
Show me the way

Only the strongest will survive
Lead me to Heaven when we die
I am the shadow on the wall
I'll be the one to save us all

You wanted it back (Don't make me mad)
(Here it comes)

(Die)

Only the strongest will survive
Lead me to Heaven when we die
I am the shadow on the wall
I'll be the one to save us all
Save us all!

9-Burn it down-Linking park-Living things 3:50
The cycle repeated
As explosions broke in the sky
All that I needed
Was the one thing I couldn't find
And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait
To burn it to the ground

The colors conflicted
As the flames, climbed into the clouds
I wanted to fix this
But couldn't stop from tearing it down
And you were there at the turn
Caught in the burning glow
And I was there at the turn
Waiting to let you know

We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait
To burn it to the ground

You told me yes
You held me high
And I believed when you told that lie
I played soldier, you played king
And struck me down, when I kissed that ring
You lost that right, to hold that crown
I built you up, but you let me down
So when you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames
As your blazes burn

And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait
To burn it to the ground

When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames
As your blazes burn

We can't wait
To burn it to the ground

When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames
As your blazes burn

We can't wait
To burn it to the ground

10-Sons of plunder- Disturbed-Ten thousand fists 4:06
Letra
Tell me you like it
Tell me you like it
You say you found yourself a new sound
The shit's loaded and ready to go
A bit too much just like the old sound
Already heard it for the hundredth time
One hundred more, all have the same sound
Running around with all the sheep that you know
"It sounds sublime, they're breaking new ground"
"They're sure to have another hit this time"

Come on, can't you just leave it alone
It doesn't have any soul
Just find a thing of your own
And stop pretending to know

As the countless numbers hunger
For worldwide renown
All the pimping sons of plunder
Will roll up their sleeves
All searching for the answers
They don't even care to know
Give it to me
Give it to me
You like it?

I'm still surrounded by the "new sound"
I've had enough and I'm ready to go
A stranglehold throughout the world now
The new obsession will fade in time
I thin reminder of the past now
All convoluted, hardly ready to go
Their whines and moans will never last now
I think you've given us our fill this time

Come on, can't you just leave it alone
It doesn't have any soul
Just find a thing of your own
And stop pretending to know

As the countless numbers hunger
For worldwide renown
All the pimping sons of plunder
Will roll up their sleeves
All searching for the answers
They don't even care to know
Give it to me
Give it to me
You like it?

As it's blown apart
Hundreds thrown away
Makes me question, just what I believe
Brothers torn apart
Mindless drones enslaved
Makes me search for an answer
I don't want to know
It's like a plague from below
Killing all that I know
One hundred voices the same
Drench their sorrow in fame

As the countless numbers hunger
For worldwide renown
All the pimping sons of plunder
Will roll up their sleeves
All searching for the answers
They don't even care to know
Give it to me
Give it to me
You like it?

As the countless numbers hunger
For worldwide renown
All the pimping sons of plunder
Will roll up their sleeves
All searching for the answers
They don't even care to know
Give it to me
Give it to me
You like it?

Tell me you like it
Tell me you like it
