    <p><br>First things first, I'ma say all the words inside my head
       <br> I'm fired up, and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh
       <br> The way that things have been, oh-ooh
       <br> Second thing second, don't you tell me what you think that I can be
       <br> I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
       <br> The master of my sea, oh-ooh
       <br> 
       <br> I was broken from a young age
       <br> Taking my sulking to the masses
       <br> Writing my poems for the few
       <br> That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feelin' me
       <br> Singing from heartache from the pain
       <br> Taking my message from the veins
       <br> Speaking my lesson from the brain
       <br> Seeing the beauty through the
       <br> 
       <br> Pain!
       <br> You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
       <br> 
       <br> Pain!
       <br> You break me down, and build me up, believer, believer
       <br> Pain!
       <br> Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
       <br> My life, my love, my drive it came from
       <br> Pain!
       <br> You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
       <br> 
       <br> Third things third, send a prayer to the ones up above
       <br> All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
       <br> Your spirit up above, oh-ooh
       <br> 
       <br> I was choking in the crowd
       <br> Building my rain up in the cloud
       <br> Falling like ashes to the ground
       <br> Hoping my feelings, they would drown
       <br> But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
       <br> Inhibited, limited, 'til it broke open, and it rained down
       <br> It rained down like
       <br> 
       <br> Pain!
       <br> You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
       <br> Pain!
       <br> You break me down, and build me up, believer, believer
       <br> Pain!
       <br> Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
       <br> My life, my love, my drive it came from
       <br> Pain!
       <br> You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
       <br> 
       <br> Last things last, by the grace of the fire and the flames
       <br> You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
       <br> The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
       <br> 
       <br> But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
       <br> Inhibited, limited, 'til it broke open, and it rained down
       <br> It rained down like
       <br> 
       <br> Pain!
       <br> You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
       <br> 
       <br> Pain!
       <br> You break me down, and build me up, believer, believer
       <br> Pain!
       <br> Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
       <br> My life, my love, my drive it came from
       <br> Pain!
       <br> You made me a, you made me a believer, believer</p>
