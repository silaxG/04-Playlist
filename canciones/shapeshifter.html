<p>Get ready
    <br>Get ready, get set
    <br>Get ready, get set, let's roll
    <br>
    <br>Ha, get ready, get set, let's roll
    <br>Roll rubber in a bit of petrol
    <br>Red, yellow, hit green, then go
    <br>Breathe in slow
    <br>
    <br>S.O.B.
    <br>You ain't never seen nothing so rugged at 90
    <br>Huh uh
    <br>Goosebumps when the cops behind me yo!
    <br>The boiler's grinding, keep the cuffs
    <br>Enjoy your doughnuts, Sir, you ain't gonna find me
    <br>
    <br>It's not likely their brains is blown out
    <br>You're chasing a ghost with no brakes, slow down
    <br>Hundred proof octane, ready to drink bitch
    <br>Stop playing, I'm hot man, gimme that pink slip
    <br>
    <br>Time's up, the animals crept through
    <br>Leave them in the dust with a packet of jet fuel
    <br>Too quick, eat 'em up, better for pet food
    <br>No brain, slow lane, missing your head screws
    <br>
    <br>Ha, skin and bones let, mess with your chrome set
    <br>Tricked out, hopping like your cruse in a cold chest
    <br>Parked in eagle with a safety pin
    <br>Take the backseat
    <br>Now let the games begin, yeah
    <br>
    <br>Ha, get ready, get set, let's roll
    <br>Roll rubber in a bit of petrol
    <br>Red, yellow, hit green, then go
    <br>Breathe in slow
    <br>
    <br>Shapeshifter!
    <br>Come on man, you can't be real
    <br>I'mma show you what it is, let the anthem build
    <br>Shapeshifter!
    <br>Put the pedal to the metal and go (Go!)
    <br>
    <br>Tough match, you lost by a hubcap
    <br>The big boss spray painted on my mud flap
    <br>Get a rush, yeah we're calling your cold bluff
    <br>We never get enough
    <br>
    <br>Step in, hold your breath and hang tight
    <br>Known for the big dollar bet in the cage fight
    <br>You're playing with the sharks, step inside
    <br>Everybody on your mark, get set, now let's ride
    <br>
    <br>That's right
    <br>Put the pedal to the metal and go
    <br>The yellow madellow with slicks on sending 'em home
    <br>Stick cars in the concrete, gripping the road
    <br>So quick, even the palm trees, look out whoa
    <br>
    <br>We got car keys hooked to remote controls
    <br>Hit a button that'll smoke any whip you own
    <br>I told you, I don't want to close your casket
    <br>Quit now before you go blowing a gasket
    <br>
    <br>Ha, get ready, get set, let's roll
    <br>Roll rubber in a bit of petrol
    <br>Red, yellow, hit green, then go
    <br>Breathe in slow
    <br>
    <br>Shapeshifter!
    <br>Come on man, you can't be real
    <br>I'mma show you what it is, let the anthem build
    <br>Shapeshifter!
    <br>Put the pedal to the metal and go (Go!)
    <br>
    <br>(Go, go, go!)
    <br>Melting!
    <br>Meltdown!
    <br>(While time is shifting)
    <br>Transist!
    <br>Transform!
    <br>(Out purposely)
    <br>
    <br>Yielding!
    <br>Bending!
    <br>(While time is shifting)
    <br>Two shapes they can't constrain!
    <br>Get ready, get set, let's roll
    <br>
    <br>Shapeshifter!
    <br>Come on man, you can't be real
    <br>I'mma show you what it is, let the anthem build
    <br>Shapeshifter!
    <br>If you want it, come and let me know
    <br>I'm right here, put the pedal to the metal and go (Go!)
    <br>
    <br>Shapeshifter!
    <br>Come on man, you can't be real
    <br>I'll show you what it is, let the anthem build
    <br>Shapeshifter!
    <br>Put the pedal to the metal and go (Go!)</p>
