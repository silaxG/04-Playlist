        <p>First Sight
            <br>Turns me round again
            <br>Brings me face to face with my sin
            <br>I've got it, Always had it
            <br>A reason to look within now
            <br>Take flight
            <br>To your son again
            <br>Burns the sin
            <br>Straight from my hands
            <br>I've got it, Always had it
            <br>A reason to live within now.
            <br>
            <br>Every time I fall, You catch me
            <br>And every time I lose control
            <br>You help me, you save me
            <br>And every time I lose myself
            <br>You find me, redefine me
            <br>
            <br>My god
            <br>Think my hands have been
            <br>Makes me sick from inside out again
            <br>I've got it, Always had it
            <br>A reason to look within now
            <br>Stand close
            <br>To my side again
            <br>Never stick a knife in my back, friend
            <br>I've got it, Always had
            <br>A reason to live within now
            <br>
            <br>Every time I fall, You catch me
            <br>And every time I lose control
            <br>You help me, you save me
            <br>And every time I lose myself
            <br>You find me, redefine me
            <br>
            <br>Somebody to make me feel whole again
            <br>Life gets better
            <br>Somebody to make me wanna love again
            <br>Life gets better
            <br>Somebody to make me see the sun again
            <br>Life gets better
            <br>Somebody to hold me
            <br>Hold me
            <br>Life feels better
            <br>
            <br>Every time I fall
            <br>
            <br>Every time I lose control
            <br>You help me, you save me
            <br>Every time I lose myself
            <br>You find me, redefine me
            <br>And every time I hate myself
            <br>You love me, forgive me
            <br>Every time I lose myself
            <br>You find me, redefine me.
