    <p>
       <br> If I had to
       <br>I would put myself right beside you 
       <br> So let me ask, would you like that?
       <br>Would you like that? 
       <br> And I don't mind 
       <br> If you say this love is the last time 
       <br> So now I'll ask, do you like that?
       <br> Do you like that? 
       <br> No!
       <br> 
       <br> Something's getting in the way
       <br> Something's just about to break
       <br> I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane
       <br> So tell me how it should be
       <br> 
       <br> Try to find out what makes you tick
       <br> As I lie down
       <br> Sore and sick, do you like that?
       <br> Do you like that?
       <br> There's a fine line between love and hate
       <br> And I don't mind
       <br> Just let me say that I like that
       <br> I like that
       <br> 
       <br> Something's getting in the way
       <br> Something's just about to break
       <br> I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane
       <br> As I burn another page
       <br> As I look the other way
       <br> I still try to find my place in the diary of Jane
       <br> So tell me how it should be
       <br> 
       <br> Desperate, I will crawl
       <br> Waiting for so long
       <br> No love, there is no love
       <br> Die for anyone
       <br> What have I become?!
       <br> 
       <br> Something's getting in the way
       <br> Something's just about to break
       <br> I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane
       <br> As I burn another page
       <br> As I look the other way
       <br> I still try to find my place in the diary of Jane</p>
