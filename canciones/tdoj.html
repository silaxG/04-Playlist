            <br> If I had to
            <br>I would put myself right beside you
            <br> So let me ask, would you like that?
            <br>Would you like that?
            <br> And I don't mind
            <br> If you say this love is the last time
            <br> So now I'll ask, do you like that?
            <br> Do you like that?
            <br> No!
            <br>
            <br> Something's getting in the way
            <br> Something's just about to break
            <br> I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane
            <br> So tell me how it should be
            <br>
            <br> Try to find out what makes you tick
            <br> As I lie down
            <br> Sore and sick, do you like that?
            <br> Do you like that?
            <br> There's a fine line between love and hate
            <br> And I don't mind
            <br> Just let me say that I like that
            <br> I like that
            <br>
            <br> Something's getting in the way
            <br> Something's just about to break
            <br> I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane
            <br> As I burn another page
            <br> As I look the other way
            <br> I still try to find my place in the diary of Jane
            <br> So tell me how it should be
            <br>
            <br> Desperate, I will crawl
            <br> Waiting for so long
            <br> No love, there is no love
            <br> Die for anyone
            <br> What have I become?!
            <br>
            <br> Something's getting in the way
            <br> Something's just about to break
            <br> I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane
            <br> As I burn another page
            <br> As I look the other way
            <br> I still try to find my place in the diary of Jane
