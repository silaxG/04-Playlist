    <h2>Letra</h2>
    <p>Tell me you like it
        <br>Tell me you like it
        <br>You say you found yourself a new sound
        <br>The shit's loaded and ready to go
        <br>A bit too much just like the old sound
        <br>Already heard it for the hundredth time
        <br>One hundred more, all have the same sound
        <br>Running around with all the sheep that you know
        <br>"It sounds sublime, they're breaking new ground"
        <br>"They're sure to have another hit this time"
        <br>
        <br>Come on, can't you just leave it alone
        <br>It doesn't have any soul
        <br>Just find a thing of your own
        <br>And stop pretending to know
        <br>
        <br>As the countless numbers hunger
        <br>For worldwide renown
        <br>All the pimping sons of plunder
        <br>Will roll up their sleeves
        <br>All searching for the answers
        <br>They don't even care to know
        <br>Give it to me
        <br>Give it to me
        <br>You like it?
        <br>
        <br>I'm still surrounded by the "new sound"
        <br>I've had enough and I'm ready to go
        <br>A stranglehold throughout the world now
        <br>The new obsession will fade in time
        <br>I thin reminder of the past now
        <br>All convoluted, hardly ready to go
        <br>Their whines and moans will never last now
        <br>I think you've given us our fill this time
        <br>
        <br>Come on, can't you just leave it alone
        <br>It doesn't have any soul
        <br>Just find a thing of your own
        <br>And stop pretending to know
        <br>
        <br>As the countless numbers hunger
        <br>For worldwide renown
        <br>All the pimping sons of plunder
        <br>Will roll up their sleeves
        <br>All searching for the answers
        <br>They don't even care to know
        <br>Give it to me
        <br>Give it to me
        <br>You like it?
        <br>
        <br>As it's blown apart
        <br>Hundreds thrown away
        <br>Makes me question, just what I believe
        <br>Brothers torn apart
        <br>Mindless drones enslaved
        <br>Makes me search for an answer
        <br>I don't want to know
        <br>It's like a plague from below
        <br>Killing all that I know
        <br>One hundred voices the same
        <br>Drench their sorrow in fame
        <br>
        <br>As the countless numbers hunger
        <br>For worldwide renown
        <br>All the pimping sons of plunder
        <br>Will roll up their sleeves
        <br>All searching for the answers
        <br>They don't even care to know
        <br>Give it to me
        <br>Give it to me
        <br>You like it?
        <br>
        <br>As the countless numbers hunger
        <br>For worldwide renown
        <br>All the pimping sons of plunder
        <br>Will roll up their sleeves
        <br>All searching for the answers
        <br>They don't even care to know
        <br>Give it to me
        <br>Give it to me
        <br>You like it?
        <br>
        <br>Tell me you like it
        <br>Tell me you like it</p>
