    <p><br>Hey-oh, here comes the danger up in this club
       <br> When we get started and we ain't gon' stop
       <br> We gon' turn it out 'til it gets too hot
       <br> Everybody sing, hey-oh
       <br> Tell 'em turn it up 'til they can't no more
       <br> Let's get this thing shakin' like a disco ball
       <br> This is your last warning, a courtesy call
       <br> 
       <br> Hey-oh, here comes the danger up in this club
       <br> When we get started and we ain't gon' stop
       <br> We gon' turn it out 'til it gets too hot
       <br> Everybody sing, hey-oh
       <br> Tell 'em turn it up 'til they can't no more
       <br> Let's get this thing shakin' like a disco ball
       <br> This is your last warning, a courtesy call
       <br> 
       <br> I am not afraid of the storm that comes my way
       <br> When it hits, it shakes me to the core
       <br> And makes me stronger than before
       <br> It's not a question about trust
       <br> But will you stand with us?
       <br> Can you feel it, make it real
       <br> 
       <br> I think it might wash away tonight
       <br> Awaken from this never-ending fight
       <br> It takes more than meets the eye
       <br> This war we're fighting is not just rotting
       <br> 
       <br> Hey-oh, here comes the danger up in this club
       <br> When we get started and we ain't gon' stop
       <br> We gon' turn it out 'til it gets too hot
       <br> Everybody sing, hey-oh
       <br> Tell 'em turn it up 'til they can't no more
       <br> Let's get this thing shakin' like a disco ball
       <br> This is your last warning, a courtesy call
       <br> 
       <br> There's a rumble in the floor
       <br> So get prepared for war
       <br> When it hits, it'll knock you to the ground
       <br> When it shakes up everything around
       <br> But survival is a must
       <br> So will you stand with us
       <br> Can you feel it, make it real
       <br> Make me feel it
       <br> 
       <br> I think it might wash away tonight
       <br> Awaken from this never-ending fight
       <br> It takes more than meets the eye
       <br> This war we're fighting is not just rotting
       <br> 
       <br> Hey-oh, here comes the danger up in this club
