    <p>The cycle repeated
        <br>As explosions broke in the sky
        <br>All that I needed
        <br>Was the one thing I couldn't find
        <br>And you were there at the turn
        <br>Waiting to let me know
        <br>
        <br>We're building it up
        <br>To break it back down
        <br>We're building it up
        <br>To burn it down
        <br>We can't wait
        <br>To burn it to the ground
        <br>
        <br>The colors conflicted
        <br>As the flames, climbed into the clouds
        <br>I wanted to fix this
        <br>But couldn't stop from tearing it down
        <br>And you were there at the turn
        <br>Caught in the burning glow
        <br>And I was there at the turn
        <br>Waiting to let you know
        <br>
        <br>We're building it up
        <br>To break it back down
        <br>We're building it up
        <br>To burn it down
        <br>We can't wait
        <br>To burn it to the ground
        <br>
        <br>You told me yes
        <br>You held me high
        <br>And I believed when you told that lie
        <br>I played soldier, you played king
        <br>And struck me down, when I kissed that ring
        <br>You lost that right, to hold that crown
        <br>I built you up, but you let me down
        <br>So when you fall, I'll take my turn
        <br>And fan the flames
        <br>As your blazes burn
        <br>
        <br>And you were there at the turn
        <br>Waiting to let me know
        <br>
        <br>We're building it up
        <br>To break it back down
        <br>We're building it up
        <br>To burn it down
        <br>We can't wait
        <br>To burn it to the ground
        <br>
        <br>When you fall, I'll take my turn
        <br>And fan the flames
        <br>As your blazes burn
        <br>
        <br>We can't wait
        <br>To burn it to the ground
        <br>
        <br>When you fall, I'll take my turn
        <br>And fan the flames
        <br>As your blazes burn
        <br>
        <br>We can't wait
        <br>To burn it to the ground
        </p>
