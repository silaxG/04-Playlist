    <p>Hu
        <br>I'm like hu-hu
        <br>Hu
        <br>I'm like hu-hu
        <br>
        <br>Hey yo, first things first
        <br>Box battle and break down
        <br>For the beak in the rhyme tone
        <br>Jump in the cyclone
        <br>S-T-Y-L-E-S, yes I know
        <br>Give the rap phene vaccine
        <br>
        <br>Packed red beam
        <br>Put 'em up, what the fuck
        <br>You plucked a bad seed
        <br>Off the wall, spittin' the guerilla tag team
        <br>What's up now, duck down stuff that can't breathe
        <br>
        <br>Yo- you know the routine, the demon effect
        <br>Please, don't step, you wanna be one of my pet peeves
        <br>The more beef the better; sound gay
        <br>But you all wanna sleep together, okay
        <br>In the club we gon' sneak Berettas
        <br>Why not? We got so much street credit, the fuckin' police let us
        <br>Now that's bullshit, 'cause we don't pack heat
        <br>So come and get your head crackin' up at me
        <br>
        <br>Kick it- movin' it's on now
        <br>Making it punk loud
        <br>Shaking the buck wild
        <br>Rapin' the punk style
        <br>Fakin' the funk pal
        <br>Dunk watch the punk
        <br>
        <br>What now? Watch your battleship get sunk down
        <br>Click (click) pow (pow) knocked (knocked) out (out)
        <br>What? Just what I thought, what's up now?
        <br>Click (click) pow (pow) knocked (knocked) out (out)
        <br>What? Just what I thought, what's up now?
        <br>
        <br>Hu
        <br>I'm like hu-hu
        <br>
        <br>Hold it down, never give in
        <br>Styles ever get limbs
        <br>Or whether you want it to end
        <br>Dirty syringe, I murder 'em again
        <br>'97 serving them sins
        <br>Uh 30 your friends get knocked out, turbulent wind
        <br>Hopped out, what you want, big verb in the gin
        <br>I'm a fish, you can tell by the flippers or fins (c'mon)
        <br>
        <br>Yo- I got a rock style
        <br>Pivot the offspring and joke with 'em
        <br>With a distorted gist off string
        <br>Who am i? Rushin' what leg? Who and Tak?
        <br>Pushin' your bed hotter than Quebec in July
        <br>Area 51, stereo, rive gun live
        <br>
        <br>Here we go, S-O-B drop some
        <br>For the kids in the hall with the new block tape
        <br>Blast from both angles like boom dock saint
        <br>So, get up, get up and let the sound hit ya
        <br>Snap it's already ya style picture, hu
        <br>
        <br>Kick it- movin' it's on now
        <br>Making it punk loud
        <br>Shaking the buck wild
        <br>Rapin' the punk style
        <br>Fakin' the funk pal
        <br>Dunk watch the punk
        <br>
        <br>What now? Watch your battleship get sunk down
        <br>Click (click) pow (pow) knocked (knocked) out (out)
        <br>What? Just what I thought, what's up now?
        <br>Click (click) pow (pow) knocked (knocked) out (out)
        <br>What? Just what I thought, what's up now?
        <br>
        <br>Hu
        <br>I'm like hu-hu
        <br>
        <br>Huh, who the hell wear splittin' the belly up on a selfish
        <br>Shinnin' in your style playin' the fell blitz
        <br>Drillin' your brain, like rap and video games
        <br>Feel the seringe for the styles that stickin' in your brain
        <br>
        <br>Yo- what kind of shit is he on
        <br>Really is styles, really be on
        <br>C'mon punk fuck off, you really gotta be gone
        <br>Ripped out of your brain
        <br>Pissed covered in shit to diss this S-O-B game
        <br>
        <br>Son of a bitch
        <br>I'ma start killin' for kicks
        <br>There ain't an Air Force 1 in the globe I can't fig, get it?
        <br>I'm sick with it, when I spit the venom
        <br>And it drips up in 'em, and it gets the women in a
        <br>Quick dilemma, we can settle it now
        <br>And I don't know who did it but they said it was styles
        <br>
        <br>(Click, pow, knocked out)
        <br>(What? Just what I thought, what's up now?)
        <br>
        <br>Hu
        <br>I'm like hu-hu
        <br>Hu
        <br>I'm like hu-hu
        <br>Hu
        <br>
        <br>(Click, pow, knocked out)
        <br>(What? Just what I thought, what's up now?)
        <br>I'm like hu-hu
        <br>(Click, pow, knocked out)
        <br>(What? Just what I thought, what's up now?)
        <br>
        <br>I'm like hu</p>
